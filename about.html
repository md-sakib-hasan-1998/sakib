                <p class="animated fadeInMessage about-content" style="text-align:justify;">I am <b>Md Sakib Hasan</b>, a graduate with 
                    a Bachelor’s in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from BRAC University. My journey 
                    through engineering has been shaped by a passion for technology, problem-solving, and 
                    innovation. Whether it's integrating Raspberry Pi into complex systems or optimizing 
                    digital marketing strategies, I love tackling challenges with a hands-on approach. 
                    <br><br> With a diverse skill set ranging from AI development for autonomous underwater 
                    vehicles to designing controllers for electric vehicle fast charging systems, I aim to 
                    contribute to cutting-edge technology that makes a difference. My time at BRACU’s 
                    Robotics Club honed my leadership and collaboration skills, where I led teams, organized 
                    national events, and taught students robotics and Arduino programming. <br><br> 
                    I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, whether in embedded systems, 
                    software testing, or digital content creation. My goal is to work on impactful projects 
                    that leverage my technical expertise while pushing the boundaries of innovation.  </p>
